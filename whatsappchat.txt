12/13/22, 5:18 PM - +92 333 5506503: It's really not good.
12/13/22, 5:18 PM - +92 333 5506503: We want to change things.

7/21/23, 10:11 AM - +92 316 2234550: The 8051.

Sometimes I see posts from freshers who study the 8051. My advise is: keep that for a rainy day and study something more state of the art like ARM or Risc-V. 

The 8051 is 43 years old. If it teaches you anything, it's the wrong things. Industry has moved on and RISC based CPUs operate in a different way. 8051 will face you with a non-orthogonal instruction set, small data size, small addressing size, limited number of registers, weird addressing modes, etc.. all of which have been overcome by successor CPUs.

To all professors, I say this:

The 8051 was an important CPU - in its time. Cherish its legacy, but please move on.

#اپلائی #کا #پہلا #مرحلہ : آپ نے ستمبر کی پہلی تاریخ سے جنوری تک چائنہ کی یونیورسٹیوں کے اپنے شعبہ کے پروفیسر سے ایکسپٹنس لیٹر لینا ہو گا ۔ وہ کیسے لینا ہے امیل کر کے ، امیل ایڈریس یونیورسٹیوں کی ویب سائٹس پر ہیں اور میرے اپنے پاس بھی ۔ امیل میں کور لیٹر ، اور اپنی سی وی اچھے فارمیٹ میں اور سٹڈی پلان یا ریسرچ پلان ایٹیچ کر کے پروفیسر کو صبح پانچ بجے سے نو بجے تک بھیجیں ۔ کچھ پروفیسر ایک ہی دن میں دے دیتے کچھ جواب دیتے ہیں انٹرویوز لیتے ہیں ، تو کچھ دیتے ہی نہیں جواب ۔ یہ لیٹر مل جانے کے بعد ۔

#دوسرا #مرحلہ : یونیورسٹیوں کے ایڈ میشن ڈیٹ اور ان میں ان لائن اپلائی کرنا ، زیادہ تر یونیورسٹیوں کی تاریخ جنوری سے مارچ ، اپریل تک ہوتی ہے ۔ اس کے بعد یونیورسٹی آپ کی اپلیکشن پر پراسیس شروع کرتا ہے کچھ یونیورسٹیاں انٹر ویو لیتی ہیں کچھ نہیں۔ اس کے بعد جون ، جولائی میں رزلٹ آنا شروع ہو جاتے ہیں پہلے یونیورسٹی سلیکٹ کرتی پھر سی ایس سی کو آپکے ڈیکومنٹس اپرو ہو کر سکالرشپ مل جاتی ہے ۔ آ پ انشاء اللہ محنت کریں پھل ضرور ملے گا ۔ آپ میں سے کسی کا بھی کوئی بھی سوال ہو وہ پوچھ سکتا ہے ۔ جزاکاللہ

8/7/23, 10:41 PM - +92 318 8347024: To get scholarships, you first need to be very proactive and keep yourself updated about different opportunities. This you can do by following very regularly 3-5 scholarship groups.

Second, you need to make a very good CV. This you can do by using the Europass format. Here is the link to build your CV in Europass.
https://europa.eu/europass/en/create-europass-cv

Third, you need to write a cover letter. How to write a cover letter. Here is the Harvard-recommended sample of Cover letters, Resumes/CVs, and good points to consider while making your CV. Have a look for details: https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/phd_resume_cover_letters.pdf

Fourth, You need to write a very good Statement of Purpose. To have a good SoP you need to read different guidelines first, At least 8-10 different sources on Google. Then you need to write your SoP as per guidelines, and once done ask your senior, friends, and teacher to review it for you and make changes accordingly. Here is the one good source I recommend following for writing your SoP.
https://web.facebook.com/groups/PScholarshipsLeague/permalink/2187187961532478

Fifth, write a 3-5 research proposal. Nowadays different scholarships and professors want you to write a research proposal for scholarships. Such proposals are often not the exact and final ones to proceed with your PhD. But the purpose of such a proposal is to put a filter on non-serious students, who apply for the sake of applying. And also to check the research aptitude skills of students. Here are good guidelines on how to write a proposal for MS and PhD admission. Have a read, if you want to have one for yourself. https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research/apply/examples-of-research-proposals/

Sixth, write your own recommendation letters. Professors are very busy; they don't have time. So every time you request a recommendation, accompany the draft and request that if you feel I have made some exaggeration, you can omit or add according. Now the newest question is how to write a good recommendation letter. Here are just the perfect guidelines for a perfect recommendation letter.
https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tsim/RecommendationLetters.htm

Seventh, you must have at least 5 online courses relevant to your future research ideas. Here is the list of 50 sources for free online courses https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1993815333971668&set=gm.1836215343296410

Ninth, learn 3-5 software like SPSS, Python, STATA, etc.

Tenth, keep applying very dedicatedly. This means when you came to know about a post that is relevant to you. So read the detail of the scholarship and the requirements. Then arrange your documents accordingly and apply.

Last, keep applying regularly as many as you can, until you get one. Apply on priority bases, as soon as possible, Because many scholarships and professors work on the basis of Pehlay Ayeyay, Pehlay Payeyay. For example, if a professor gives acceptance to someone on the first day of application start, so he will not accept you, even if 60  days/2 months remain in the deadline, even if you have a good profile. Because the seat is already occupied by someone else. No more space for you. Be mentally prepared for at least 15 rejections and then expect some positive outcomes.

To conclude, all these things to be done, require Zero Money, Zero Travelling. You can do it 100% sitting in your bed.

Why should other people help you? You should EARN the Right to be helped.

11/8/23, 1:55 PM - +92 311 9581376: Can someone do this? 
write a code in matlab that will connect the aurduio in mathlab to take the numbers of distance.
11/8/23, 1:55 PM - +92 311 9581376: Please inbox
Urgently
11/8/23, 1:58 PM - +92 316 2030303: To connect an Arduino to MATLAB and read distance values from a sensor, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.

2. Upload a simple Arduino sketch that reads distance values from a sensor (e.g., ultrasonic distance sensor like HC-SR04) and sends them over the serial port. Here's an example Arduino code:

```arduino
#include <Ultrasonic.h>

Ultrasonic ultrasonic(2, 3); // Trigger pin, Echo pin

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  float distance = ultrasonic.Ranging(CM);
  Serial.println(distance);
  delay(1000); // Update every second
}
```

3. In MATLAB, you can use the "serial" object to communicate with the Arduino over the serial port. Here's a MATLAB code example to read and plot the distance values:

```matlab
arduino = serial('COMX', 'BaudRate', 9600); % Replace 'COMX' with the correct COM port
fopen(arduino);

try
    while true
        distance = fscanf(arduino, '%f');
        fprintf('Distance: %.2f cm\n', distance);
        
        % You can perform any further processing or plotting here
        
        pause(1); % Read data every 1 second
    end
catch
    fclose(arduino);
    delete(arduino);
end
```

Make sure to replace 'COMX' with the actual COM port where your Arduino is connected.

4. Run the MATLAB code, and it will continuously read and display the distance values from the Arduino.

This code is a basic example. You can modify it according to your specific sensor and project requirements. Also, make sure you have the required MATLAB Support Package for Arduino installed.

Please note that the Arduino IDE and MATLAB should not use the same COM port simultaneously, so close the Arduino IDE or any other software accessing the Arduino when using MATLAB for communication.

2:- Let’s start with the easy method and fast which depends on your work. If you know any company or any PEC recognized university and have resources in administration, you can ask them to hire you directly through this program.

After filling this form call to PEC office 0519219036 (ext. 121) and ask them that a company hired you for a six month and your employer filled out the above given form for hiring through this program. They will provide you a mail kainaat.saeed@pec.org.pk to share your appointment letter and form filling a screenshot. 
After this process they will give you a letter of appointment through PEC ojt program which you have to send back with the sign of your employer who hired you. This way you will be hired by the PEC OJT program.

After getting attendance print the form through your employer and upload it on the given form provided by PEC to the employer email. The same steps will be played up to six months. And you will get 30000 with in two weeks of form filling.
